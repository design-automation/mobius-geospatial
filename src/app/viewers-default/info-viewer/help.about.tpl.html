    <h2>
        Visual Programming
    </h2>
    <p>
        In Möbius, users are provided with a set of visual programming tools to
        define scripts for generating models. These tools integrate two types of
        visual programming: flowcharts and procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Flowcharts consist of nodes connected together with wires. Each node in the
        flowchart has a set of input and output ports, and contains a small
        procedure to perform some type of action.
    </p>
    <p>
        Procedures consist of a sequence of lines of code. There are four types of
        code lines: 1) variables assignments, 2) ‘for-each’ loops, 3) ‘if-else’
        conditions, and 4) function calls.
    </p>
    <p>
        Function calls are lines of code that call a particular function. Libraries
        of different functions are provided. Additional libraries of functions can
        be added at any stage.
    </p>
    <h2>
        User Interface
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Möbius Modeller user interface consists of four main viewports, with
        one viewport on the left and three viewports on the right. The viewports
        can be rearrange into any configuration. By default, the Output viewport is
        on the right side, and the Flowchart, Procedure and Parameters viewports
        are on the right side.
    </p>
    <p>
        · The Flowchart viewports is for defining the flowcharts, consisting of
        nodes connected with wires. Selecting one of the nodes in the Flowchart
        viewport will change the contents of the other three viewports.
    </p>
    <p>
        · The Procedure viewport is for defining the procedure inside each node.
        The procedure that is shown is for the node selected in the Flowchart
        viewport.
    </p>
    <p>
        · The Parameters viewport is for setting the parameter values associated
        with each node. The parameters that are shown are for the node selected in
        the Flowchart viewport. This viewport also contain the green ‘Execute
        Flowchart’ button, which will execute the flowchart using the specified
        parameter values.
    </p>
    <p>
        · The Output viewport is for viewing the output generated by executing the
        script, as well as for viewing Help. The Output viewport has a number of
        different viewers. The most basic viewer is the Text Viewer, which is for
        viewing basic text. There is also an Output console, which is where various
        messages (including error messages) get printed.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img
            width="600"

            src="./assets/img/info/image002.png"
        />
    </p>
    <h2>
        Flowchart
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Flowchart viewport allows you to create and delete nodes, and to wire
        them together into a network. The flowchart flows from left to right, and
        form a chain of execution. Nodes without wires attached to any of the
        inputs are called “start nodes”, and nodes without wires attached to any of
        the outputs are called “end nodes”. (An “isolated node” has neither.)
    </p>
    <p>
        When a flowchart is executed, the first nodes to be executed are all the
        start nodes. The data produced by the nodes will travel down the wires to
        the next set of nodes, which are then executed. This continues until end
        nodes are reached on the right hand side.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img
            width="249"
            height="91"
            src="./assets/img/info/image004.jpg"
        />
    </p>
    <p>
        When a flowchart is executed, the data generated by each output of each
        node is saved. This means that after execution, you can explore the data
        generated by each node by clicking on its output ports and view the results
        in one of the Output viewers. (See the section on Outputs.)
    </p>
    <p>
        When wiring nodes together, inputs can only have a single wire attached.
        However, outputs can have multiple wires attached. If an output has
        multiple wires attached, then the data is copied and sent down each wire
        separately.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img
            width="186"
            height="193"
            src="./assets/img/info/image006.jpg"
        />
    </p>
    <p>
        If a node has multiple inputs, then it will not be executed until all the
        data for all its inputs has been received.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img
            width="165"
            height="166"
            src="./assets/img/info/image008.jpg"
        />
    </p>
    <p>
        The left sidebar allows you perform various operations:
    </p>
    <p>
        · Save and Load Flowcharts as a file. These are saved as .mob files. It is
        important to save often.
    </p>
    <p>
        · Create new nodes and subnets. (Subnets are coming soon.)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Save and Load Libraries of nodes as a file.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Each node has three buttons (only displayed when the node is selected):
    </p>
    <p>
        · Delete: Deletes the node. This cannot be undone, so be careful!
    </p>
    <p>
        · Disable: Disables the node. When the network is executed, the network
        behaves as if the node did not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        · Save: Saves the node to your library, stored in the browser cache.
    </p>
    <p>
        Saving nodes allows you to use them multiple times in different Flowcharts.
        It also allows you to share nodes with others. Note that the library is
        stored in the browser cache. If you clear your cache, then you will lose
        all your saved nodes. Therefore, if you have nodes that you want to keep,
        it is a good idea to save them to file.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Procedure
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Procedure viewport allows you to define the procedure that gets
        executed inside a node. The Procedure shown in this viewport is for the
        node selected in the flowchart.
    </p>
    <p>
        The procedure is basically a small script, but rather than typing the
        script in a text editor, you create your Procedure by dragging and dropping
        lines of code into the script.
    </p>
    <p>
        The procedure consists of three sections, each of which can be expanded and
        contracted. The Input and Outputs sections list the input and outputs for
        the node. For each input and output, the name can be set, and the type can
        be selected from a drop-down list. Based on the selection, other settings
        can be set. Selecting an input or output line will show a ‘delete’ button
        on the right hand side, allowing you to delete it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main procedure is define under the Procedure section. The procedure
        consists of a sequence of lines of code that get executed one at a time.
        These lines of code will read data from the inputs and write data to the
        outputs. In the example below, the procedure has three lines of code that
        do the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Creates a variable called ‘my_var’ and sets its value to the value from
        the first input multiplied by 10.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Creates a second variable called ‘rand_num’ and uses a function call to
        set its value to a random number between 0 and 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Set the value of the first output (named ‘out0’) to the value of
        ‘my_var’ divided by the value of ‘rand_num’.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img
            width="201"
            height="152"
            src="./assets/img/info/image010.jpg"
        />
    </p>
    <p>
        Procedures will typically include one or more function calls, and may also
        include various variable assignments, for-each loops, and if-else
        conditions. Clicking any of these items in the left sidebar will add them
        to the procedure, underneath the currently selected line. The lines of code
        can be repositioned by dragging and dropping.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are four types of lines of code that can be inserted:
    </p>
    <p>
        · Variable: Create a new variable or assigns a value to an existing
        variable. Variables can have different data types. See Data Types for a
        more detailed explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
        · For-each loop: Create a loop that repeats the operations inside it,
        multiple times. See For-Loop for a more detailed explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
        · If-else condition: Create a conditional statement, and execute the
        operations inside it based on whether the condition is true or false.
    </p>
    <p>
        · Function: Call a function in the built the function library.
    </p>
    <p>
        Selecting or hovering on a line in the procedure will show a set of buttons
        on the right hand side.
    </p>
    <p>
        · Help: Show the help for the particular function. The help will be
        displayed in under the Output viewport.
    </p>
    <p>
        · Print: Prints the value generated by that line of code to the console.
        This is mainly used for debugging.
    </p>
    <p>
        · Disable: Disables the line of code. When the code is executed, it will
        simply ignore this line of code.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Delete: Deletes the line of code.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For more information about writing Procedures, see the Procedure help file.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Parameters
    </h2>
    <p>
        Each node can have zero or more parameters whose values can be set in the
        Parameters viewport. The parameters shown in this viewport are for the node
        selected in the flowchart.
    </p>
    <p>
        The parameters are all node inputs for which no wires have been attached.
        In the example below, the node has three inputs. The first input (‘in0’)
        has a wire attached, so it does not appear as a parameter. The other two
        parameters have no wires, so these will appear as Parameters whose values
        you can set manually in the parameters viewport.
    </p>

        />
        <img

            height="112"
            src="./assets/img/info/image014.jpg"
        />
    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking the execute button will execute the flowchart with the specified
        parameters.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Output
    </h2>
    <p>
        Once a flowchart has been executed, the results can be viewed in the Output
        viewport. The outputs that are shown in this viewport are for the node
        selected in the flowchart.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Output viewport has a number of different viewers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Console viewer shows messages resulting from the execution of the
        flowchart. Each message has a time stamp and a short piece of text. If any
        errors occurred, then an error message will also be shown. These outputs
        are not linked to any particular node. As a result, selecting different
        nodes in the flowchart has no effect on what is being displayed in the
        Console. This is not the case with the other Output viewers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Console is an important viewer when debugging. For example, in the
        example below, the ‘print’ on the variable called ‘rand_num’ was enabled,
        which resulted in the value being printed out as a console message. This
        allows you to see that variable was set to a value of ‘0.154…’.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img
            width="202"
            height="189"
            src="./assets/img/info/image016.jpg"
        />
    </p>
    <p>
        The Text viewer shows the output or all the outputs of the node selected in
        the Viewport. This is the most basic was of looking at the output of the
        node, and works for any type of output. If the output is actually a text
        value, then it is directly printed in the text viewer. If the output is not
        text, then it is first converted to text and shown in the viewer.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img
            width="132"
            height="219"
            src="./assets/img/info/image018.jpg"
        />
        <img
            width="77"
            height="100"
            src="./assets/img/info/image020.jpg"
        />
    </p>
    <p>
        The 3D viewer shows the output for the selected output port for the
        selected node in the flowchart. Selecting different nodes and different
        output ports in the flowchart will change what is being displayed in the 3D
        viewer. However, note that the 3D viewer will only be able to display the
        output if the content is compatible. Thus, if an output port is outputting
        some text, then there is little that the 3D viewer will be able to do with
        this and as a result nothing will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to make switching between viewers easier, each output port has a
        default Viewer. When an output port is selected, and the Output window will
        automatically switch to that default Viewer. In the example below, the
        first output (‘out0’) is set to use the Console viewer is set to use the
        Console Viewer, while the other two outputs (‘out1’ and ‘out2’) are set to
        use the Text Viewer.
