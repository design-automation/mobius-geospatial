When you execute the procedure, your computer will execute the each line of code, one by one. It is like a sequence of instructions.\n\n\n\n    // code on line 1\n    // code on line 2\n    // code on line 3\n\n\n\n    (Note that in the code example above, each line starts with a \"//\". This is actually a shorthand to indicate that this line consists of a comment. The computer will ignore such lines.)\n\n\n\n    (Note also that in this document, various code snippet are given as examples. The code that you create in Möbius of course looks a little different, but the structure is exactly the same. We are just writing the code snippets in this way in order to avoid having to do lots of screen captures. Each code snippet is assumed to be independent and stand alone.)\n\n\n\n    In general, the flow of the execution goes one line at a time, top to bottom. You can change this linear behaviour by using if-else conditions and for-loops. More on that later.\n\n\n\n    Each line of code can contain various types of statements. The most basic is a variable assignment.\n\n\nVariables\n\n\n    A variable can be thought of as a named container in which you can place some data. A variable is something like this:\n\n\n\n    x = 123\n\n\n\n    In the above code, the variable named x contains the number 123. We can say: \"the value of the variable is 123\". The first time you use a variable like this, it gets declared, which creates the container in memory. Once it is declared, you can change the value at any time.\n\n\n\n    x = 123\n    x = 456\n\n\n\n    In the above code, the variable named x was used for the first time, and value was set to 123. Then, on the second line, the value 123 was discarded and replaced with the value 456. We can say: \"the value of 456 was assigned to the variable x\". You can change the value as many times as you like.\n\n\n\n    By convention, variables are typically named using lowercase letters only. For example, \"my_variable\". The variable name should not contain spaces, or any special character. Also, it should not start with a number.\n\n\nPrimitive Data Types\n\n\n    The data that you assign to a variable can have different types. Möbius allows you to work with three primitive data types:\n\n\n\n    Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.\n    Strings of text e.g. \"This text string\" etc.\n    Boolean e.g. true or false.\n\n\n\n    Below is an example of some variable assignments for the three different primitive data types:\n\n\n\n    my_age = 47\n    my_name = \"Patrick\"\n    lives_in_sg = true\n\n\n\n    There is also a special data type called null. When a value has already been assigned, and you want to clear it without assigning some other value, then you can assign null.\n\n\n\n    my_age = 47\n    // do some other stuff\n    my_age = null\n\n\n\n    Strings can contain a lot of data. Here is an example of a longer string:\n\n\n\n    some_text = \"The Möbius Modeller is a 3D parametric modelling software. It has a visual programming interface that combines dataflow programming with blocks-based programming. Dataflow programming is used to define the overall structure of your code, using nodes connected by wires. Blocks-based programming is used to define the individual procedures in each of your nodes. Procedures contain fours main types if elements: 1) variables, 2) if-else conditions, 3) for loops, and 4) function calls.\"\n\n\n\n    In the example above, the variable called some_text is assigned a longer string. A string can also be much longer than that - for example, maybe a whole book.\n\n\n\n    Also, note also that strings can contain text that looks like a number, but that is actually not a number data type. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n    text_that_looks_like_number = \"123.456\"\n    a_number = 123.456\n\n\n\n    Note that characters in a string can also be accessed using the square bracket notation. For example:\n\n\n\n    my_name = \"patrick\"\n    first_letter = my_name[0]\n    last_letter = my_name[6]\n\n\n\n    The square bracket notation for indexing will be explained in more detail in the section on lists.\n\n\nList Data Types\n\n\n    The three primitive data types already allow many useful procedures to be written. However, there is one key problem: none of them allow you to handle collections of data items. When creating procedures, you will find that a lot of data needs to managed as a collection.\n\n\n\n    For example, lets say you have 10 people in your group, and you want to store their names. You could create 10 variables, named person1=\"patrick\", person2=\"kainwee\", person3=\"akshata\",etc, and assign each one a different name. But that would get tedious. You could store them all in one string, for example: people=\"patrick, kainwee, akshata\". But that is rather inflexible, since everything is stored in a single lump of text.\n\n\n\n    In order to be easily handle collections of data, Möbius allows you to use a list data type. A list lets you store multiple values in a single variable. A list is defined using square brackets, like this:\n\n\n\n    names_list = [\"patrick\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\"]\n    some_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6.7, 1000, 2000]\n\n\n\n    In the first line of the above code, a variable called names_list has been created, and a value has been assigned to it that has a list data type. The list has three items inside it, each of which is a string. In the second line, a variable called some_numbers has been created, and the value is a list of various numbers.\n\n\n\n    The items in a list can be accessed using a zero based index. This index starts at zero, and counts up the list, one item at a time. So in the names_list above, \"patrick\" is at index 0, \"kianwee\" at 1, and \"akshata\" at 2. Below is an example of accessing items in names_list:\n\n\n\n    names_list = [\"patrick\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\"]\n    person = names_list[1]\n\n\n\n    The variable called person is now assigned the value \"kianwee\". (This is because \"kainwee\" is at index position 1.) If you wanted to assign \"patrick\" to person, one would write names_list[0], if you wanted \"akshata\", one would write names_list[2]. Note that for the first item, the index is 0, and for teh last item the index is the list length minus 1.\n\n\n\n    The same approach can be used in order to set the values of the items in a list. For example, we could change one of the names as follows:\n\n\n\n    names_list = [\"patrick\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\"]\n    names_list[0] = \"patrick_janssen\"\n\n\n\n    The names_list would contain three items, namely [\"patrick_janssen\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\"]. You can also add items to the list, like this.\n\n\n\n    names_list = [\"patrick\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\"]\n    names_list[3] = \"kamel\"\n\n\n\n    The names_list would contain four items, namely [\"patrick\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\", \"kamel\"].\n\n\n\n    In some cases, rather than filling a list with items, we may instead need to create an empty list, that then gets filled later. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n    names_list = []\n    // some other code\n    names_list[0] = \"joie\"\n    names_list[1] = \"derek\"\n\n\nPassing Data: By Value and By Reference\n\n\n    Finally, the last thing to say about lists goes a little deeper into programming concepts. It may not be immediately relevant when you first get started, but still it s worth mentioning. It relates to how data is passed around. There are basically two ways that data can get passed: by value and by reference. Lets say you set variable_a = variable_b:\n\n\n\n    By Value: The data value in variable_a is copied, and assigned to variable_b. The two variables now have separate values stored in different locations in memory. The two values will currently be the same, but if you later change one, the other will not be affected.\n    By Reference: A reference to the data value in variable_a is copied, and the reference is assigned to variable_b. The two variables now have the same value stored in the same locations in memory. This means that is you change the value of one variable, the other will change as well.\n\n\n\n\n    The easiest way to understand this is with a pair of example. The first example will be using primitive data types (which are passed by value), and the second with a list data type (which is passed by reference).\n\n\n\n    a = 5\n    b = a\n    a = 6\n\n\n\n    The question is, after executing all three lines of code, what is the value of b? The answer is 5. If we follow this line by line it makes sense.\n\n\n\n    Line 1) We set the value of a to 5. \n    Line 2) We set the value of b to a. This results in the value being passed by value.\n    Line 3) We change the value of a to 6. This does not affect b in any way,\n\n\n\n    Now lets look at a similar case using lists.\n\n\n\n\n    list_a = [1, 2, 3] \n    list_b = list_a\n    list_a[0] = 10\n\n\n\n    The question again is, after executing all three lines of code, what is the value of b? The answer is [10, 2, 3]. This may be more surprising. Why is the first item now 10? In the third line, we change a, not b. Lets set through it line by line.\n\n\n\n    Line 1: We set the value of list_a to [1, 2, 3]. \n    Line 2: We set the value of list_b to list_a. This results in the value being passed by reference.\n    Line 3: We change the value of a to [10, 2, 3]. Since list_a and list_b are referencing the same value, this means that list_b now also has a value of [10, 2, 3]. \n\n\nExpressions\n\n\n    As we have see above, a variable assignment has an \"=\" with something on the left and something on the right. The left hand side must specify a container in which the data will be stored. This can either be a variable name (for example my_variable), or, if the variable type is a list, then it can be a variable name with an index (for example, my_list[1]).\n\n\n\n    The right hand side of the assignment operator can be more interesting. So far, we have only been assigning a value. But on the right side you can write more complex expressions. For example:\n\n\n\n    my_variable = ((4 * 3) / 2) - 1\n\n\n\n    Expressions can use arithmetic and comparison operators. For example, let us take a simple expression: 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands and ‘+’ is called the operator, which in this case is an arithmetic operator.\n\n\n\n    The arithmetic operators are as follows:\n\n\n\n    + (Addition) Adds two operands\n    - (Subtraction) Subtracts the second operand from the first\n    * (Multiplication) Multiply both operands\n    / (Division) Divide the numerator by the denominator\n    % (Modulus) Outputs the remainder of an integer division\n    ++ (Increment) Increases an integer value by one\n    -- (Decrement) Decreases an integer value by one\n\n\n\n    The comparison operators are as follows:\n\n\n\n    (A == B) Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes, then the condition becomes true. \n    (A != B) Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.\n    (A > B) Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.\n    (A \n    (A >= B) Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.\n    (A \n\n\nIf-else Conditions\n\n\n    While creating a procedure, there may be a situation when you need to perform different actions based on different conditions.\n\n\n\n    Möbius supports an if-else conditional statements. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n    if (variable_a > 100)\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;// execute the code that is inside the if, only if the condition is true\n    else\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;// execute the code that is inside the else, only if the condition is not true\n\n\n\n    (In the Möbius procedure window, pay attention to the left indentation of the code. You can drag your lines of code into the if-else block, and they will become indented. This indicates that they are inside the if-condition, or the else condition.)\n\n\n\n    In this case, if variable_a is greater than 100, then the first set of code is executed. Otherwise the second set of code is executed.\n\n\nFor-each Loops\n\n\n    While creating a procedure, you may encounter a situation where you need to perform an action over and over again. In such situations, you would need to write loop statements.\n\n\n\n    Möbius provides a for-each loop that allows you to loop over a list of values.\n\n\n\n    list_of_items = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n    if (item in list_of_items)\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;// execute the code that is inside the loop multiple times, using item\n\n\n\n    (In the Möbius procedure window, pay attention to the left indentation of the code. You can drag your lines of code into the for-loop block, and they will become indented. This indicates that they are inside the loop.)\n\n\n\n    The example above shows the basic loop construct. The list_of_items contains five values, so the loop will execute five times. Each time, the a variable called item is created with a new value. The first time around the loop, item will have a value of 10, the second time, it will have a value of 20, and so forth. Each time around the loop, the code will most likely do something useful with this item variable.\n\n\nVariable Scope\n\n\n    When using if-else conditions and for-each loops, it is important to look a little deeper at creating variables. If-else condition and for-each loops define inner blocks of code (shown graphically by the level of indentation). These blocks of code can have multiple lines, and these lines may include the creation of new variables. The are certain rules that define where variables are visible, referred to as the variable scope.\n\n\n\n    Lets assume you you create variable in your procedure called variable_a. Where can you use that variable name? Which is the same as asking, where is that variable \"in scope\"? (If you do it wrong, you will get a \"ReferenceError\" when you run your program.) To figure this out, you need to follow two basic rules (both rules need to be true).:\n\n\n\n    Rule 1: The line of code accessing the variable must come after the line of code that created the variable. \n    Rule 2: The line of code accessing the variable must be contained inside the code block that created the variable.\n\n\n\n    Lets look at an example, and analyse it line by line.\n\n\n\n    a = 2\n    if (condition)\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;b = a * 4\n    c = b * 6 // ReferenceError\n\n\n\n    Line 1:The variable a is created.\n    Line 2:The if creates a code sub-block, with a single line of code in it. There are now two code blocks, the main code block of the procedure, and nested inside that, this if code sub-block.\n    Line 3:This line is inside the if code block, which is inside the main code block. A new variable, b is created. The value is set to a multiplied by 4. In this cases, there is no problem accessing the variable a, because both rules are true. Rule 1: Line 3 come after line 1. Rule 2: Line 3 is inside the line 1 code block.\n    Line 4:This line is inside the if code block. This line generates an ReferenceError. A new variable, c is created, no problem here. But the problem occurs when the value is set to b multiplied by 6. In this cases, line 4 cannot access the variable b define on line 3. Rule 1 is still OK: Line 4 come after line 3. However, Rule 2 is not OK: Line 4 is not inside the line 3 code block. So, as far as this line is concerned, variable b does not exist.\n\n\n\n    Basically, anything you create in these inner code blocks is not visible to the code outside the block. To someone who is new to programming, this may seem annoying. However, it is actually a good thing, since it avoids many errors that are hard to catch. Furthermore, there is actually a simple way to fix this, as follows:\n\n\n\n    a = 2\n    b = 0 // a default value\n    if (condition)\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;b = a * 4\n    c = b * 6\n\n\n\n    Since b is now created in the main code block, the last line no longer has an error.\n\n\nFunctions\n\n\n    Finally, we get to the functions, which is where most of the useful operations can be performed. Möbius allow users to create procedures that call a set of predefined functions, organised into modules to make the easier to find. These functions are all called it the same way.\n\n\n\n    The function name species the function to be called.\n    The function inputs are called the \"arguments\", and are specified in round brackets after the function name. \n    The function may have an output, which is called the \"return value\". If it has a return value, then the return value will typically be assigned to a variable.\n\n\n\n    For example, consider the string.len() function that calculates the length of a string.\n\n\n\n    my_str = \"This is some text.\"\n    result = string.len(my_str)\n\n\n\n    In this case, the module name is string, and the function name is len. The function takes one argument as input, which is the string whose length needs to be calculated, which in this case is my_str. The function returns a number (the length of the string), which gets assigned to the variable called result.\n\n\n\n    The sections below give help documentation on all the functions available in Möbius.\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                Legend\n            \n            \n                Html element\n            \n            \n                Component\n            \n            \n                Html element with directive\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        var COMPONENT_TEMPLATE = 'Fundamentals    In order to get a better understanding of creating procedures in Möbius, it will be helpful to review some of the fundamental constructs of programming.    Execution    Variables    Primitive Data Types    List Data Type    Passing Data: By Value and By Reference    Expressions    If-else Conditions    For-each Loop    Variable Scope    FunctionsExecution    A procedure consists of a sequence of lines of code. When you execute the procedure, your computer will execute the each line of code, one by one. It is like a sequence of instructions.    // code on line 1    // code on line 2    // code on line 3    (Note that in the code example above, each line starts with a \"//\". This is actually a shorthand to indicate that this line consists of a comment. The computer will ignore such lines.)    (Note also that in this document, various code snippet are given as examples. The code that you create in Möbius of course looks a little different, but the structure is exactly the same. We are just writing the code snippets in this way in order to avoid having to do lots of screen captures. Each code snippet is assumed to be independent and stand alone.)    In general, the flow of the execution goes one line at a time, top to bottom. You can change this linear behaviour by using if-else conditions and for-loops. More on that later.    Each line of code can contain various types of statements. The most basic is a variable assignment.Variables    A variable can be thought of as a named container in which you can place some data. A variable is something like this:    x = 123    In the above code, the variable named x contains the number 123. We can say: \"the value of the variable is 123\". The first time you use a variable like this, it gets declared, which creates the container in memory. Once it is declared, you can change the value at any time.    x = 123    x = 456    In the above code, the variable named x was used for the first time, and value was set to 123. Then, on the second line, the value 123 was discarded and replaced with the value 456. We can say: \"the value of 456 was assigned to the variable x\". You can change the value as many times as you like.    By convention, variables are typically named using lowercase letters only. For example, \"my_variable\". The variable name should not contain spaces, or any special character. Also, it should not start with a number.Primitive Data Types    The data that you assign to a variable can have different types. Möbius allows you to work with three primitive data types:    Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.    Strings of text e.g. \"This text string\" etc.    Boolean e.g. true or false.    Below is an example of some variable assignments for the three different primitive data types:    my_age = 47    my_name = \"Patrick\"    lives_in_sg = true    There is also a special data type called null. When a value has already been assigned, and you want to clear it without assigning some other value, then you can assign null.    my_age = 47    // do some other stuff    my_age = null    Strings can contain a lot of data. Here is an example of a longer string:    some_text = \"The Möbius Modeller is a 3D parametric modelling software. It has a visual programming interface that combines dataflow programming with blocks-based programming. Dataflow programming is used to define the overall structure of your code, using nodes connected by wires. Blocks-based programming is used to define the individual procedures in each of your nodes. Procedures contain fours main types if elements: 1) variables, 2) if-else conditions, 3) for loops, and 4) function calls.\"    In the example above, the variable called some_text is assigned a longer string. A string can also be much longer than that - for example, maybe a whole book.    Also, note also that strings can contain text that looks like a number, but that is actually not a number data type. Here is an example:    text_that_looks_like_number = \"123.456\"    a_number = 123.456    Note that characters in a string can also be accessed using the square bracket notation. For example:    my_name = \"patrick\"    first_letter = my_name[0]    last_letter = my_name[6]    The square bracket notation for indexing will be explained in more detail in the section on lists.List Data Types    The three primitive data types already allow many useful procedures to be written. However, there is one key problem: none of them allow you to handle collections of data items. When creating procedures, you will find that a lot of data needs to managed as a collection.    For example, lets say you have 10 people in your group, and you want to store their names. You could create 10 variables, named person1=\"patrick\", person2=\"kainwee\", person3=\"akshata\",etc, and assign each one a different name. But that would get tedious. You could store them all in one string, for example: people=\"patrick, kainwee, akshata\". But that is rather inflexible, since everything is stored in a single lump of text.    In order to be easily handle collections of data, Möbius allows you to use a list data type. A list lets you store multiple values in a single variable. A list is defined using square brackets, like this:    names_list = [\"patrick\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\"]    some_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6.7, 1000, 2000]    In the first line of the above code, a variable called names_list has been created, and a value has been assigned to it that has a list data type. The list has three items inside it, each of which is a string. In the second line, a variable called some_numbers has been created, and the value is a list of various numbers.    The items in a list can be accessed using a zero based index. This index starts at zero, and counts up the list, one item at a time. So in the names_list above, \"patrick\" is at index 0, \"kianwee\" at 1, and \"akshata\" at 2. Below is an example of accessing items in names_list:    names_list = [\"patrick\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\"]    person = names_list[1]    The variable called person is now assigned the value \"kianwee\". (This is because \"kainwee\" is at index position 1.) If you wanted to assign \"patrick\" to person, one would write names_list[0], if you wanted \"akshata\", one would write names_list[2]. Note that for the first item, the index is 0, and for teh last item the index is the list length minus 1.    The same approach can be used in order to set the values of the items in a list. For example, we could change one of the names as follows:    names_list = [\"patrick\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\"]    names_list[0] = \"patrick_janssen\"    The names_list would contain three items, namely [\"patrick_janssen\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\"]. You can also add items to the list, like this.    names_list = [\"patrick\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\"]    names_list[3] = \"kamel\"    The names_list would contain four items, namely [\"patrick\", \"kianwee\", \"akshata\", \"kamel\"].    In some cases, rather than filling a list with items, we may instead need to create an empty list, that then gets filled later. Here is an example:    names_list = []    // some other code    names_list[0] = \"joie\"    names_list[1] = \"derek\"Passing Data: By Value and By Reference    Finally, the last thing to say about lists goes a little deeper into programming concepts. It may not be immediately relevant when you first get started, but still it s worth mentioning. It relates to how data is passed around. There are basically two ways that data can get passed: by value and by reference. Lets say you set variable_a = variable_b:    By Value: The data value in variable_a is copied, and assigned to variable_b. The two variables now have separate values stored in different locations in memory. The two values will currently be the same, but if you later change one, the other will not be affected.    By Reference: A reference to the data value in variable_a is copied, and the reference is assigned to variable_b. The two variables now have the same value stored in the same locations in memory. This means that is you change the value of one variable, the other will change as well.    The easiest way to understand this is with a pair of example. The first example will be using primitive data types (which are passed by value), and the second with a list data type (which is passed by reference).    a = 5    b = a    a = 6    The question is, after executing all three lines of code, what is the value of b? The answer is 5. If we follow this line by line it makes sense.    Line 1) We set the value of a to 5.     Line 2) We set the value of b to a. This results in the value being passed by value.    Line 3) We change the value of a to 6. This does not affect b in any way,    Now lets look at a similar case using lists.    list_a = [1, 2, 3]     list_b = list_a    list_a[0] = 10    The question again is, after executing all three lines of code, what is the value of b? The answer is [10, 2, 3]. This may be more surprising. Why is the first item now 10? In the third line, we change a, not b. Lets set through it line by line.    Line 1: We set the value of list_a to [1, 2, 3].     Line 2: We set the value of list_b to list_a. This results in the value being passed by reference.    Line 3: We change the value of a to [10, 2, 3]. Since list_a and list_b are referencing the same value, this means that list_b now also has a value of [10, 2, 3]. Expressions    As we have see above, a variable assignment has an \"=\" with something on the left and something on the right. The left hand side must specify a container in which the data will be stored. This can either be a variable name (for example my_variable), or, if the variable type is a list, then it can be a variable name with an index (for example, my_list[1]).    The right hand side of the assignment operator can be more interesting. So far, we have only been assigning a value. But on the right side you can write more complex expressions. For example:    my_variable = ((4 * 3) / 2) - 1    Expressions can use arithmetic and comparison operators. For example, let us take a simple expression: 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands and ‘+’ is called the operator, which in this case is an arithmetic operator.    The arithmetic operators are as follows:    + (Addition) Adds two operands    - (Subtraction) Subtracts the second operand from the first    * (Multiplication) Multiply both operands    / (Division) Divide the numerator by the denominator    % (Modulus) Outputs the remainder of an integer division    ++ (Increment) Increases an integer value by one    -- (Decrement) Decreases an integer value by one    The comparison operators are as follows:    (A == B) Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes, then the condition becomes true.     (A != B) Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.    (A > B) Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.    (A     (A >= B) Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.    (A If-else Conditions    While creating a procedure, there may be a situation when you need to perform different actions based on different conditions.    Möbius supports an if-else conditional statements. Here is an example:    if (variable_a > 100)      // execute the code that is inside the if, only if the condition is true    else      // execute the code that is inside the else, only if the condition is not true    (In the Möbius procedure window, pay attention to the left indentation of the code. You can drag your lines of code into the if-else block, and they will become indented. This indicates that they are inside the if-condition, or the else condition.)    In this case, if variable_a is greater than 100, then the first set of code is executed. Otherwise the second set of code is executed.For-each Loops    While creating a procedure, you may encounter a situation where you need to perform an action over and over again. In such situations, you would need to write loop statements.    Möbius provides a for-each loop that allows you to loop over a list of values.    list_of_items = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]    if (item in list_of_items)      // execute the code that is inside the loop multiple times, using item    (In the Möbius procedure window, pay attention to the left indentation of the code. You can drag your lines of code into the for-loop block, and they will become indented. This indicates that they are inside the loop.)    The example above shows the basic loop construct. The list_of_items contains five values, so the loop will execute five times. Each time, the a variable called item is created with a new value. The first time around the loop, item will have a value of 10, the second time, it will have a value of 20, and so forth. Each time around the loop, the code will most likely do something useful with this item variable.Variable Scope    When using if-else conditions and for-each loops, it is important to look a little deeper at creating variables. If-else condition and for-each loops define inner blocks of code (shown graphically by the level of indentation). These blocks of code can have multiple lines, and these lines may include the creation of new variables. The are certain rules that define where variables are visible, referred to as the variable scope.    Lets assume you you create variable in your procedure called variable_a. Where can you use that variable name? Which is the same as asking, where is that variable \"in scope\"? (If you do it wrong, you will get a \"ReferenceError\" when you run your program.) To figure this out, you need to follow two basic rules (both rules need to be true).:    Rule 1: The line of code accessing the variable must come after the line of code that created the variable.     Rule 2: The line of code accessing the variable must be contained inside the code block that created the variable.    Lets look at an example, and analyse it line by line.    a = 2    if (condition)      b = a * 4    c = b * 6 // ReferenceError    Line 1:The variable a is created.    Line 2:The if creates a code sub-block, with a single line of code in it. There are now two code blocks, the main code block of the procedure, and nested inside that, this if code sub-block.    Line 3:This line is inside the if code block, which is inside the main code block. A new variable, b is created. The value is set to a multiplied by 4. In this cases, there is no problem accessing the variable a, because both rules are true. Rule 1: Line 3 come after line 1. Rule 2: Line 3 is inside the line 1 code block.    Line 4:This line is inside the if code block. This line generates an ReferenceError. A new variable, c is created, no problem here. But the problem occurs when the value is set to b multiplied by 6. In this cases, line 4 cannot access the variable b define on line 3. Rule 1 is still OK: Line 4 come after line 3. However, Rule 2 is not OK: Line 4 is not inside the line 3 code block. So, as far as this line is concerned, variable b does not exist.    Basically, anything you create in these inner code blocks is not visible to the code outside the block. To someone who is new to programming, this may seem annoying. However, it is actually a good thing, since it avoids many errors that are hard to catch. Furthermore, there is actually a simple way to fix this, as follows:    a = 2    b = 0 // a default value    if (condition)      b = a * 4    c = b * 6    Since b is now created in the main code block, the last line no longer has an error.Functions    Finally, we get to the functions, which is where most of the useful operations can be performed. Möbius allow users to create procedures that call a set of predefined functions, organised into modules to make the easier to find. These functions are all called it the same way.    The function name species the function to be called.    The function inputs are called the \"arguments\", and are specified in round brackets after the function name.     The function may have an output, which is called the \"return value\". If it has a return value, then the return value will typically be assigned to a variable.    For example, consider the string.len() function that calculates the length of a string.    my_str = \"This is some text.\"    result = string.len(my_str)    In this case, the module name is string, and the function name is len. The function takes one argument as input, which is the string whose length needs to be calculated, which in this case is my_str. The function returns a number (the length of the string), which gets assigned to the variable called result.    The sections below give help documentation on all the functions available in Möbius.'\n    var COMPONENTS = [{'name': 'AppComponent', 'selector': 'app-root'},{'name': 'CesiumViewerComponent',

web-application for parametric\n        modelling. It runs in the Chrome browser.\n    \n\n    \n       Getting started with Möbius\n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n        Visual Programming\n    \n    \n        In Möbius, users are provided with a set of visual programming tools to\n        define scripts for generating models. These tools integrate two types of\n        visual programming: flowcharts and procedures.\n    \n    \n        Flowcharts consist of nodes connected together with wires. Each node in the\n        flowchart has a set of input and output ports, and contains a small\n        procedure to perform some type of action.\n    \n    \n        Procedures consist of a sequence of lines of code. There are four types of\n        code lines: 1) variables assignments, 2) ‘for-each’ loops, 3) ‘if-else’\n        conditions, and 4) function calls.\n    \n    \n        Function calls are lines of code that call a particular function. Libraries\n        of different functions are provided. Additional libraries of functions can\n        be added at any stage.\n    \n    \n        User Interface\n    \n    \n        The Möbius Modeller user interface consists of four main viewports, with\n        one viewport on the left and three viewports on the right. The viewports\n        can be rearrange into any configuration. By default, the Output viewport is\n        on the right side, and the Flowchart, Procedure and Parameters viewports\n        are on the right side.\n    \n    \n        · The Flowchart viewports is for defining the flowcharts, consisting of\n        nodes connected with wires. Selecting one of the nodes in the Flowchart\n        viewport will change the contents of the other three viewports.\n    \n    \n        · The Procedure viewport is for defining the procedure inside each node.\n        The procedure that is shown is for the node selected in the Flowchart\n        viewport.\n    \n    \n        · The Parameters viewport is for setting the parameter values associated\n        with each node. The parameters that are shown are for the node selected in\n        the Flowchart viewport. This viewport also contain the green ‘Execute\n        Flowchart’ button, which will execute the flowchart using the specified\n        parameter values.\n    \n    \n        · The Output viewport is for viewing the output generated by executing the\n        script, as well as for viewing Help. The Output viewport has a number of\n        different viewers. The most basic viewer is the Text Viewer, which is for\n        viewing basic text. There is also an Output console, which is where various\n        messages (including error messages) get printed.\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Flowchart\n    \n    \n        The Flowchart viewport allows you to create and delete nodes, and to wire\n        them together into a network. The flowchart flows from left to right, and\n        form a chain of execution. Nodes without wires attached to any of the\n        inputs are called “start nodes”, and nodes without wires attached to any of\n        the outputs are called “end nodes”. (An “isolated node” has neither.)\n    \n    \n        When a flowchart is executed, the first nodes to be executed are all the\n        start nodes. The data produced by the nodes will travel down the wires to\n        the next set of nodes, which are then executed. This continues until end\n        nodes are reached on the right hand side.\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        When a flowchart is executed, the data generated by each output of each\n        node is saved. This means that after execution, you can explore the data\n        generated by each node by clicking on its output ports and view the results\n        in one of the Output viewers. (See the section on Outputs.)\n    \n    \n        When wiring nodes together, inputs can only have a single wire attached.\n        However, outputs can have multiple wires attached. If an output has\n        multiple wires attached, then the data is copied and sent down each wire\n        separately.\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        If a node has multiple inputs, then it will not be executed until all the\n        data for all its inputs has been received.\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        The left sidebar allows you perform various operations:\n    \n    \n        · Save and Load Flowcharts as a file. These are saved as .mob files. It is\n        important to save often.\n    \n    \n        · Create new nodes and subnets. (Subnets are coming soon.)\n    \n    \n        \n            Save and Load Libraries of nodes as a file.\n        \n    \n    \n        Each node has three buttons (only displayed when the node is selected):\n    \n    \n        · Delete: Deletes the node. This cannot be undone, so be careful!\n    \n    \n        · Disable: Disables the node. When the network is executed, the network\n        behaves as if the node did not exist.\n    \n    \n        · Save: Saves the node to your library, stored in the browser cache.\n    \n    \n        Saving nodes allows you to use them multiple times in different Flowcharts.\n        It also allows you to share nodes with others. Note that the library is\n        stored in the browser cache. If you clear your cache, then you will lose\n        all your saved nodes. Therefore, if you have nodes that you want to keep,\n        it is a good idea to save them to file.\n    \n    \n        Procedure\n    \n    \n        The Procedure viewport allows you to define the procedure that gets\n        executed inside a node. The Procedure shown in this viewport is for the\n        node selected in the flowchart.\n    \n    \n        The procedure is basically a small script, but rather than typing the\n        script in a text editor, you create your Procedure by dragging and dropping\n        lines of code into the script.\n    \n    \n        The procedure consists of three sections, each of which can be expanded and\n        contracted. The Input and Outputs sections list the input and outputs for\n        the node. For each input and output, the name can be set, and the type can\n        be selected from a drop-down list. Based on the selection, other settings\n        can be set. Selecting an input or output line will show a ‘delete’ button\n        on the right hand side, allowing you to delete it.\n    \n    \n        The main procedure is define under the Procedure section. The procedure\n        consists of a sequence of lines of code that get executed one at a time.\n        These lines of code will read data from the inputs and write data to the\n        outputs. In the example below, the procedure has three lines of code that\n        do the following:\n    \n    \n        1. Creates a variable called ‘my_var’ and sets its value to the value from\n        the first input multiplied by 10.\n    \n    \n        2. Creates a second variable called ‘rand_num’ and uses a function call to\n        set its value to a random number between 0 and 1.\n    \n    \n        3. Set the value of the first output (named ‘out0’) to the value of\n        ‘my_var’ divided by the value of ‘rand_num’.\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Procedures will typically include one or more function calls, and may also\n        include various variable assignments, for-each loops, and if-else\n        conditions. Clicking any of these items in the left sidebar will add them\n        to the procedure, underneath the currently selected line. The lines of code\n        can be repositioned by dragging and dropping.\n    \n    \n        There are four types of lines of code that can be inserted:\n    \n    \n        · Variable: Create a new variable or assigns a value to an existing\n        variable. Variables can have different data types. See Data Types for a\n        more detailed explanation.\n    \n    \n        · For-each loop: Create a loop that repeats the operations inside it,\n        multiple times. See For-Loop for a more detailed explanation.\n    \n    \n        · If-else condition: Create a conditional statement, and execute the\n        operations inside it based on whether the condition is true or false.\n    \n    \n        · Function: Call a function in the built the function library.\n    \n    \n        Selecting or hovering on a line in the procedure will show a set of buttons\n        on the right hand side.\n    \n    \n        · Help: Show the help for the particular function. The help will be\n        displayed in under the Output viewport.\n    \n    \n        · Print: Prints the value generated by that line of code to the console.\n        This is mainly used for debugging.\n    \n    \n        · Disable: Disables the line of code. When the code is executed, it will\n        simply ignore this line of code.\n    \n    \n        \n            Delete: Deletes the line of code.\n        \n    \n    \n        For more information about writing Procedures, see the Procedure help file.\n    \n    \n        Parameters\n    \n    \n        Each node can have zero or more parameters whose values can be set in the\n        Parameters viewport. The parameters shown in this viewport are for the node\n        selected in the flowchart.\n    \n    \n        The parameters are all node inputs for which no wires have been attached.\n        In the example below, the node has three inputs. The first input (‘in0’)\n        has a wire attached, so it does not appear as a parameter. The other two\n        parameters have no wires, so these will appear as Parameters whose values\n        you can set manually in the parameters viewport.\n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        Clicking the execute button will execute the flowchart with the specified\n        parameters.\n    \n    \n        Output\n    \n    \n        Once a flowchart has been executed, the results can be viewed in the Output\n        viewport. The outputs that are shown in this viewport are for the node\n        selected in the flowchart.\n    \n    \n        The Output viewport has a number of different viewers.\n    \n    \n        The Console viewer shows messages resulting from the execution of the\n        flowchart. Each message has a time stamp and a short piece of text. If any\n        errors occurred, then an error message will also be shown. These outputs\n        are not linked to any particular node. As a result, selecting different\n        nodes in the flowchart has no effect on what is being displayed in the\n        Console. This is not the case with the other Output viewers.\n    \n    \n        The Console is an important viewer when debugging. For example, in the\n        example below, the ‘print’ on the variable called ‘rand_num’ was enabled,\n        which resulted in the value being printed out as a console message. This\n        allows you to see that variable was set to a value of ‘0.154…’.\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        The Text viewer shows the output or all the outputs of the node selected in\n        the Viewport. This is the most basic was of looking at the output of the\n        node, and works for any type of output. If the output is actually a text\n        value, then it is directly printed in the text viewer. If the output is not\n        text, then it is first converted to text and shown in the viewer.\n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        The 3D viewer shows the output for the selected output port for the\n        selected node in the flowchart. Selecting different nodes and different\n        output ports in the flowchart will change what is being displayed in the 3D\n        viewer. However, note that the 3D viewer will only be able to display the\n        output if the content is compatible. Thus, if an output port is outputting\n        some text, then there is little that the 3D viewer will be able to do with\n        this and as a result nothing will be displayed.\n    \n    \n        In order to make switching between viewers easier, each output port has a\n        default Viewer. When an output port is selected, and the Output window will\n        automatically switch to that default Viewer. In the example below, the\n        first output (‘out0’) is set to use the Console viewer is set to use the\n        Console Viewer, while the other two outputs (‘out1’ and ‘out2’) are set to\n        use the Text Viewer.\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                Legend\n            \n            \n                Html element\n            \n            \n                Component\n            \n            \n                Html element with directive\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        var COMPONENT_TEMPLATE = '            Möbius Modeller                Möbius Modeller is a free and open-source web-application for parametric        modelling. It runs in the Chrome browser.               Getting started with Möbius                                        Visual Programming                In Möbius, users are provided with a set of visual programming tools to        define scripts for generating models. These tools integrate two types of        visual programming: flowcharts and procedures.                Flowcharts consist of nodes connected together with wires. Each node in the        flowchart has a set of input and output ports, and contains a small        procedure to perform some type of action.                Procedures consist of a sequence of lines of code. There are four types of        code lines: 1) variables assignments, 2) ‘for-each’ loops, 3) ‘if-else’        conditions, and 4) function calls.                Function calls are lines of code that call a particular function. Libraries        of different functions are provided. Additional libraries of functions can        be added at any stage.                User Interface                The Möbius Modeller user interface consists of four main viewports, with        one viewport on the left and three viewports on the right. The viewports        can be rearrange into any configuration. By default, the Output viewport is        on the right side, and the Flowchart, Procedure and Parameters viewports        are on the right side.                · The Flowchart viewports is for defining the flowcharts, consisting of        nodes connected with wires. Selecting one of the nodes in the Flowchart        viewport will change the contents of the other three viewports.                · The Procedure viewport is for defining the procedure inside each node.        The procedure that is shown is for the node selected in the Flowchart        viewport.                · The Parameters viewport is for setting the parameter values associated        with each node. The parameters that are shown are for the node selected in        the Flowchart viewport. This viewport also contain the green ‘Execute        Flowchart’ button, which will execute the flowchart using the specified        parameter values.                · The Output viewport is for viewing the output generated by executing the        script, as well as for viewing Help. The Output viewport has a number of        different viewers. The most basic viewer is the Text Viewer, which is for        viewing basic text. There is also an Output console, which is where various        messages (including error messages) get printed.                                Flowchart                The Flowchart viewport allows you to create and delete nodes, and to wire        them together into a network. The flowchart flows from left to right, and        form a chain of execution. Nodes without wires attached to any of the        inputs are called “start nodes”, and nodes without wires attached to any of        the outputs are called “end nodes”. (An “isolated node” has neither.)                When a flowchart is executed, the first nodes to be executed are all the        start nodes. The data produced by the nodes will travel down the wires to        the next set of nodes, which are then executed. This continues until end        nodes are reached on the right hand side.                                When a flowchart is executed, the data generated by each output of each        node is saved. This means that after execution, you can explore the data        generated by each node by clicking on its output ports and view the results        in one of the Output viewers. (See the section on Outputs.)                When wiring nodes together, inputs can only have a single wire attached.        However, outputs can have multiple wires attached. If an output has        multiple wires attached, then the data is copied and sent down each wire        separately.                                If a node has multiple inputs, then it will not be executed until all the        data for all its inputs has been received.                                The left sidebar allows you perform various operations:                · Save and Load Flowcharts as a file. These are saved as .mob files. It is        important to save often.                · Create new nodes and subnets. (Subnets are coming soon.)                            Save and Load Libraries of nodes as a file.                        Each node has three buttons (only displayed when the node is selected):                · Delete: Deletes the node. This cannot be undone, so be careful!                · Disable: Disables the node. When the network is executed, the network        behaves as if the node did not exist.                · Save: Saves the node to your library, stored in the browser cache.                Saving nodes allows you to use them multiple times in different Flowcharts.        It also allows you to share nodes with others. Note that the library is        stored in the browser cache. If you clear your cache, then you will lose        all your saved nodes. Therefore, if you have nodes that you want to keep,        it is a good idea to save them to file.                Procedure                The Procedure viewport allows you to define the procedure that gets        executed inside a node. The Procedure shown in this viewport is for the        node selected in the flowchart.                The procedure is basically a small script, but rather than typing the        script in a text editor, you create your Procedure by dragging and dropping        lines of code into the script.                The procedure consists of three sections, each of which can be expanded and        contracted. The Input and Outputs sections list the input and outputs for        the node. For each input and output, the name can be set, and the type can        be selected from a drop-down list. Based on the selection, other settings        can be set. Selecting an input or output line will show a ‘delete’ button        on the right hand side, allowing you to delete it.                The main procedure is define under the Procedure section. The procedure        consists of a sequence of lines of code that get executed one at a time.        These lines of code will read data from the inputs and write data to the        outputs. In the example below, the procedure has three lines of code that        do the following:                1. Creates a variable called ‘my_var’ and sets its value to the value from        the first input multiplied by 10.                2. Creates a second variable called ‘rand_num’ and uses a function call to        set its value to a random number between 0 and 1.                3. Set the value of the first output (named ‘out0’) to the value of        ‘my_var’ divided by the value of ‘rand_num’.                                Procedures will typically include one or more function calls, and may also        include various variable assignments, for-each loops, and if-else        conditions. Clicking any of these items in the left sidebar will add them        to the procedure, underneath the currently selected line. The lines of code        can be repositioned by dragging and dropping.                There are four types of lines of code that can be inserted:                · Variable: Create a new variable or assigns a value to an existing        variable. Variables can have different data types. See Data Types for a        more detailed explanation.                · For-each loop: Create a loop that repeats the operations inside it,        multiple times. See For-Loop for a more detailed explanation.                · If-else condition: Create a conditional statement, and execute the        operations inside it based on whether the condition is true or false.                · Function: Call a function in the built the function library.                Selecting or hovering on a line in the procedure will show a set of buttons        on the right hand side.                · Help: Show the help for the particular function. The help will be        displayed in under the Output viewport.                · Print: Prints the value generated by that line of code to the console.        This is mainly used for debugging.                · Disable: Disables the line of code. When the code is executed, it will        simply ignore this line of code.                            Delete: Deletes the line of code.                        For more information about writing Procedures, see the Procedure help file.                Parameters                Each node can have zero or more parameters whose values can be set in the        Parameters viewport. The parameters shown in this viewport are for the node        selected in the flowchart.                The parameters are all node inputs for which no wires have been attached.        In the example below, the node has three inputs. The first input (‘in0’)        has a wire attached, so it does not appear as a parameter. The other two        parameters have no wires, so these will appear as Parameters whose values        you can set manually in the parameters viewport.                                        Clicking the execute button will execute the flowchart with the specified        parameters.                Output                Once a flowchart has been executed, the results can be viewed in the Output        viewport. The outputs that are shown in this viewport are for the node        selected in the flowchart.                The Output viewport has a number of different viewers.                The Console viewer shows messages resulting from the execution of the        flowchart. Each message has a time stamp and a short piece of text. If any        errors occurred, then an error message will also be shown. These outputs        are not linked to any particular node. As a result, selecting different        nodes in the flowchart has no effect on what is being displayed in the        Console. This is not the case with the other Output viewers.                The Console is an important viewer when debugging. For example, in the        example below, the ‘print’ on the variable called ‘rand_num’ was enabled,        which resulted in the value being printed out as a console message. This        allows you to see that variable was set to a value of ‘0.154…’.                                The Text viewer shows the output or all the outputs of the node selected in        the Viewport. This is the most basic was of looking at the output of the        node, and works for any type of output. If the output is actually a text        value, then it is directly printed in the text viewer. If the output is not        text, then it is first converted to text and shown in the viewer.                                        The 3D viewer shows the output for the selected output port for the        selected node in the flowchart. Selecting different nodes and different        output ports in the flowchart will change what is being displayed in the 3D        viewer. However, note that the 3D viewer will only be able to display the        output if the content is compatible. Thus, if an output port is outputting        some text, then there is little that the 3D viewer will be able to do with        this and as a result nothing will be displayed.                In order to make switching between viewers easier, each output port has a        default Viewer. When an output port is selected, and the Output window will        automatically switch to that default Viewer. In the example below, the        first output (‘out0’) is set to use the Console viewer is set to use the        Console Viewer, while the other two outputs (‘out1’ and ‘out2’) are set to        use the Text Viewer.

To start using Mobius, all you need to do is:\n\nCreate an account\nAdd the function libraries you require\nCreate some default nodes (optional)\nSend a link to your personal Mobius Environment\n\nMobius Components\n\nAn Editor: To create projects\nA Gallery: Gallery to display projects created with Mobius, in your environment\n\nStyle Guidelines\nhttps://angular.io/guide/styleguide#general-naming-guidelines\nCurrent Structure\nMobius starts of in the editor route\nThe main folder - consists of the components referred to by the routes\nMain folder consists of:\n\nmobius-editor\nmobius-gallery\nmobius-landing\nmobius-viewer\n\nMobius Editor\nThe entire UI is placed in split-containers. The plugin used for this is angular-split. \nMainly, there are four components here - \n\napp_panel with panel_id='top'\napp_panel with panel_id='middle'\napp_panel with panel_id='bottom'\napp_panel with panel_id='main'\n\napp_panel is the same component. It has a uniform header, displaying the name of the currently selected node and the name of the component it contains - like the flowchart viewer, editor etc. The definition for this component can be found in the layout folder\nPanel Component\nPanel Component contains two things\n\nHeader: with the active node name and a button to maximize the panel\nng-container: to dynamically insert a component (flowchart, procedure etc)\n\nThis component was built like this to enable switching and maximizing of the panel components. \nThis component listens to the layout service and updates it's contents based on\nwhich viewer is supposed to displayed in which container. \nFor example, if the layout service changes to house to flowchart viewer in \nthe panelcomponent with name ='bottom', this component will then change to \nupdate ng-container to contain the flowchart viewer\n.. this maynot be the right approach?\nMain Components in Panel Component\nViewer Container\nViewer container contains all the viewers capable of rendering outputs. Currently, it also contains the helpviewer and module library viewer, but this needs to be shifted out\nThis also uses an ng-container to dynamically substitute the viewers\nFuture Feature:\nThis should allow for the user to add / remove different types of viewers to better visualize the data being generated by the nodes. \n!This is can all be packaged as a separate mode\nDifferent kinds of viewers available:\n\nCesiumViewerComponent\nCodeViewerComponent\nConsoleComponent\nEditorComponent\nGeometryViewerComponent\nHelpFundamentals\nHelpModel\nHelpViewerComponent\nInfoViewerComponent\nTextViewerComponent\n\nFlowchartViewerComponent (different module)\nFlowchart viewer component contains the following components: \n\nFlowchartControls\nGraphEdge\nGraphNode\n\nThis renders the nodes and edges in the graph. \n[these flowchart controls should actually be mobius file functions]\nThe flowchartControls component contains the following functionality-\n\nload_file\nnew_file\nnew_flowchart\npublish_settings\nopen_picker\nsave_file\nadd_node (anomaly - should be shifted to flowchart)\n\n(fileloaddialog component, )\nEditorComponent (different module)\nThe editor component allows you to edit the inputs and procedure code associated with a single node. it always operates on a single node. it is like manipulating the contents of a node.\nThe components used in the editorcomponent are - \n\napp-modulebox (put this functionality in a service and remove the component )\nthe functions and procedure lines that can be added\n(add input/output, add variable, add for loop, add while loop, add functions .... )\n\napp-parametereditor\nto modify input / output: acts on a single node; \nallows you to add / delete; updates names of i/o, update type of i/ol update settings for io\n\napp-procedureeditor\nrearrange different lines\ncut copy paste delete ask for help\n(use monaco editor here?)\nfill in the blanks for the procedure lines\n\n\nParameterViewer Component (should be incorporated into the flowchart)\n(shouldn't this be incorporated into the flowchart?)\n\nexecutes the flowchart\nsets the values in the node (shows the sliders etc)\n\nthere should a mobius module that maps from flowchart component to the procedure component and vice versa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                   Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n                        Preamble  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nDefinitions.\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\nSource Code.\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\nBasic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\nProtecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n\nThis requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\nTermination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\nPatents.\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nNo Surrender of Others' Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\nUse with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  How to Apply These Terms to Your New ProgramsIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\nCopyright (C) {year}  {name of author}\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
